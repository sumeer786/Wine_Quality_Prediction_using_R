# Logistic Regression & Random Forest Models to Predict Red Wine Quality in R

The dataset contains 1,599 observations and 12 attributes related to the red variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine. Each row describes the physicochemical properties of one bottle of wine. The first 11 independent variables display numeric information about these characteristics, and the last dependent variable revels the quality of the wine on a scale from 0 (bad quality wine) to 10 (good quality wine) based on sensory data.

Since the outcome variable is ordinal, I chose logistic regression and random forest classification algorithms
